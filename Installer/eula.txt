The Windows desktop application is free if you bought the Ema Personal Wiki 1.0 app for Android, otherwise you will have to pay a small amount, see the website for details. If you have bought a license, it allows you personally to use the software. So, if you buy a new computer, or if you are using two computers, you may install the software more than once. Please contact Jan Willem Boer in case of any trouble with this. And because the author is in a generous mood, you may also install the software for your spouse and children if this helps you and/or them.
